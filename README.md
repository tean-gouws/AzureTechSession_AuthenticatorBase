# Top Secret

If you are reading this document, you have been chosen to be part of an elite team of software developers. Today the FBI needs your help on a top-secret mission. 

## Your Mission

Over the past few weeks there has been several attempts at gaining unauthorized access to our systems by attempts to crack, snoop and extort account information from our agents. 

We need you to create an alternative means of authentication on our portals. Usernames and Password does not cut it anymore, we need something much more unique. Your mission is to create an identity provider that make use of a combination of facial and voice recognition to ensure that access to our system is secure. The solution needs to be implemented using Microsoft Azure Serverless Technologies.

## Mission Overview

### Objective 1: Agent Registration and Face Training Logic App with CosmosDB

A static registration web page has already been created. This page will allow an agent to capture his/her information and then take several photos and voice recordings to train the recognition system. For your first objective you must create the required cloud services to register agents and capture their faces on Azure Cognitive Services. As time is of the essence, the best course of action will be to make use of Microsoft Azure Logic Apps.
